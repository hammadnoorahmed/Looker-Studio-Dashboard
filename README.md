# Looker-Studio-Dashboard
The repository contains Looker Studio Operations Dashboard.

Importantly, from this dashboard, lessons learned and insights for supply chain and operations are:

1. Track the overall orders with respect to location, categories, and segments. 

2. Overall trends to manage operations and workforce. Since orders are high in November and December, more capacity will be required in terms of human capital and machinery.

3. Based on categories and segments, we can also manage our resources accordingly. 

This dashboard presents a basic understanding but these foundations can be replicated to manage other operations. Moreover, there are other metrics based on data and business operations which can also be used for better business operations.
